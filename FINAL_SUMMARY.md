---

## 📊 COMPLETE SYSTEM (All 6 Steps)

### Step 1: Market Data Stream ✅
- Real AAPL stock data from Yahoo Finance
- 390 data points streaming sequentially
- Configurable timing and symbols

### Step 2: Trading Algorithm ✅
- Percentage change strategy (±2% threshold)
- Automated BUY/SELL/HOLD decisions
- Portfolio management ($10,000 initial)

### Step 3: Attack Injection ✅
- Simulated cyber attack (15% spike)
- Configurable attack parameters
- Demonstrates financial vulnerability

### Step 4: Anomaly Detection ✅
- Z-score statistical analysis
- Rolling window (20 prices)
- Real-time anomaly flagging

### Step 5: Trust Score Engine ✅
- Severity-based scoring (0-100)
- Risk classification (SAFE/CAUTION/DANGEROUS)
- Dynamic trust evaluation

### Step 6: Trading Protection ✅
- Trust-based trade blocking
- Automated safeguards
- Loss prevention mechanism

## 🎯 DEMONSTRATION FLOW

### 1. Problem (2 minutes)
**Show:** `python integration_attack_test.py`

- Market data streaming normally
- Cyber attack injected at step 30
- Price manipulated: $259.60 → $298.54
- Trading bot makes wrong decision (BUY)
- **Financial loss: $38.70**

**Key Message:** "Without protection, market manipulation causes real financial losses."

---

### 2. Solution (3 minutes)
**Show:** `python integration_protection_test.py`

- Same attack scenario
- **Anomaly detected:** Z-score = 5.4
- **Trust evaluated:** Score drops to 60 (CAUTION)
- **Risk classified:** System warns or blocks
- **Protection applied:** Trade prevented or warned
- **Loss minimized or prevented**

**Key Message:** "Our system detects, evaluates, and protects in real-time."

---

### 3. Technical Details (2 minutes)

**Architecture:**
```
Market Data → Attack → Detection → Trust → Protection → Trading
```

**Key Technologies:**
- Z-score statistical analysis (99.7% confidence)
- Dynamic trust scoring (0-100 scale)
- Automated protection mechanism

**Innovation:**
- First real-time data integrity system for financial markets
- Combines detection with automated protection
- Prevents losses before they occur
