## Executive Summary

Modern financial markets rely on real-time digital data feeds to drive trading, pricing, and risk decisions. However, these data streams are assumed to be trustworthy without independent verification. If corrupted or manipulated, they can trigger incorrect automated trading decisions, market instability, and large financial losses. 

This project implements a **real-time Market Data Integrity Monitoring System** that verifies the reliability of market data before financial systems act on it.

---

## Problem Statement

The current financial ecosystem faces critical vulnerabilities:

- Market data feeds can be manipulated or corrupted
- Algorithmic trading systems trust incoming data blindly
- Incorrect data can trigger automated trading errors
- Creates systemic financial and cybersecurity risk

---

## National Financial Risk

Unverified market data poses significant threats to financial stability:

- **Flash crashes** from incorrect data signals
- **Incorrect derivatives pricing**
- **Institutional trading losses**
- **Market manipulation**
- **Loss of investor confidence**
- **Systemic instability**

---

## Project Objectives

The system aims to:

1. Monitor market data streams in real time
2. Detect abnormal price behavior
3. Calculate data reliability score
4. Alert trading systems and regulators
5. Prevent decisions on corrupted data
